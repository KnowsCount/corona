# Kill corona

### üìñ Story

I recently came up with the idea to 'reverse engineer' corona as I read articles done by George Hotz giving me some inspirations on it (he gave analogies between computer terminology & biology). 
Now realising the fact that it is too hard for me only to do all research, I found @Caliton-Universe, who is very good at science, to do some research for me, and is currently my partner. 

**Now to the topic**

----

### üìå  The First Analogy

Biological systems are fundamentally information processing systems. Whilst not a perfect analogy, software provides a useful framework for thinking about biology. 

### üìë Info

- This is currently written in Python. Currently I merely have some dictionaries made in order to decode the corona DNA series, Proteins, RNAs, and such. However, more investigations & thoughts (that I have no idea at all on) will be done in order to have me some ideas. 
- I am not at all expecting a success. Nevertheless, it will be happy to me if I can contribute even a tiny bit to the human healthcare. 
- I will upload all codes via [GitHub](https://www.github.com/KnowsCount/corona) in no longer than a month. Taking the suggestions given by @Caliton-Universe (that we shall not make it open-sourced) & Mrs Reed (that we shall at least leave our names), I give it a MIT license. 
- This Project, along with [MIT licensing](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/MITË®±ÂèØË≠â) for the code, also is licensed [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh). 

As I have previously stated, we are making some progress now by making some dictionaries that decodes the biological series (not sure if named so). 

### üìà Progress

- BP (Base Pairs);
- Genetic Translation; 
- Proteins; 
- Codons; 
- Maybe a conspiracy from NCBI (just kidding... It might be my own mistake writing the code); 

### üéâ Wishes

- We obviously want one to give suggestions if one can; 
- To maybe join the development if can work well; 
- To like the project... and maybe give a star in future GitHub repository.

### Biology vs. software

Biological systems are fundamentally [information processing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processor). While not a perfect analogy, software provides a useful framework for thinking about biology. The table below provides a rough outline of this analogy.
